# project-salvage
A work-in-progress game project developed in Unity (scripted in C#).

Salvage is a game that I (Joseph Wilson) have been developing myself in Unity. It is barebones and currently deep into systems development. It is my first foray into game development and game programming.
All art is placeholder, is not owned by me and is simply for testing and prototyping purposes.
Salvage is a top-down tile-based colony simulation/management game, inspired by games like RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress.


Backstory:
In the not-so-distant future, humanity has destroyed itself through climate change. Overpolluting of the atmosphere has heavily damaged the electromagnetic field that protects the Earth from the Sun, 
leading to incredible amounts of solar radiation baking the surface below. A ruined atmosphere has dramatically increased temperatures everywhere. Humanity is stuck in an apocalyptic scenario, 
and everyone is left to fend for themselves. Needing to survive the harsh days and brutal environment, your group of survivors must salvage what they can from the abandoned and overgrown factories of 
the old world and use what you can to survive. Raid the penthouses of the rich for luxuries, or raid warehouses full of different useful goods for your survivors.

The Present:
The world being overtaken by apocalypse, everyone is left to fend for themselves.
Salvage resources like scrap-metal, steel, scrap-wood, plastic etc. and use them in a variety of ways from storage to a shelter safehaven from the scorching sun.
Daytime is way too hot and dangerous. Night is the only time that's safe from solar hazards. Essentially, flips the script on "Go out by day get back by night" trope


Current features:
Simple intro ("opal studios" is a fake studio name that I own; same as "san junipero studios")
Main menu, with different screens for settings, and placeholders for credits and a "logbook" feature
Game screen, where you have a working tile system and can place different tiles. A click-and-drag-to-place feature is also developed
Work-in-progress save-load system that still needs work

Planned features:
Extensive health and personality/trait system for survivors
The ability to take apart, dismantle, and repurpose basically every object or thing in the game
Perform incursions into cities and populated areas to get resources to scrap and salvage; this mechanic would be similar to going out at night in This War of Mine
Deadly sun and environmental events make timing and living awkward; surviving is a challenge
Extensive jobs and skills system that governs how well survivors can build, farm, salvage, and so forth
